# Introduction
Python programs that hashes a simple text using different hashing algorithms.

### Hashing
- Hashing is a method of cryptography that converts any form of data into a unique string of text. Any piece of data can be hashed, no matter its size or type.
- Hashing is a mathematical operation that is easy to perform, but extremely difficult to reverse. 
- The most widely used hashing functions are MD5, SHA512, blake2b and SHAKE_256.

### Advantages
- The average user encounters hashing daily in the context of passwords.
- This enciphered text can be stored instead of the password in the database.
- It makes it difficult for the Attackers who try to access the database. They are forced to decipher those hash values before futher exploitation.

### Requirements :
Python 3, terminal or any IDE (vscode, pycharm)

### Setup : 
1. Download Python 3 and IDE: 
   1. https://www.python.org/downloads/ (python 3)
   2. https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows (pycharm)
   3. https://code.visualstudio.com/download (vscode)

2. Download repository :
   1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
   2. Under the repository name, click Clone or Download.
   3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.
   4. Open Git Bash.
   5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
   6. Alternatively, you can download its .zip file and store it to your desired location on the system.

3. Run code : 
   1. Terminal/Command Prompt - python _*program*_.py / python3 _*program*_.py
   2. Alternatively, use an IDE
